# Wiki-Project

For this project I used a lot of middleware. Here are some of the middleware process I downloaded:
I required express, 
express-validator for article validation,
bodyparser,
mongoose, 
handlebars as my view engine,
flash,
session to store my users logged in session,,
Mongo-DB (with my URI),
and an environment variable (dotenv)
