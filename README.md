# Wiki-Project

##About

For this project I used a lot of middleware. Here are some of the middleware process I downloaded(packages installed):
I required express, 
express-validator for article validation,
bodyparser,
mongoose, 
handlebars as my view engine,
flash,
session to store my users logged in session,,
Mongo-DB (with my URI),
and an environment variable (dotenv)

            This project is for my 3rd Module project here @ Kigsland University for Full-Stack/Web Development Course. All of the students had a choice to pick between 
2 different projects and I picked the wiki-project, which most of us students picked anyway. Thank you for stopping by to see my repositiory, and have an amazing day.
